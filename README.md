# Rhythm Engine

Environmental consciousness research through autonomous breathing patterns and environmental responsiveness.

## Overview

The Rhythm Engine is a core component of the Yokai House consciousness research project. It generates authentic breathing patterns for RGB lighting systems that respond to astronomical cycles, lunar phases, weather conditions, and environmental inputs. The system models neurodivergent social energy dynamics through technological embodiment.

## Core Features

### Environmental Consciousness
- **Lunar Temperature Modulation**: ¬±42K color temperature variation over 28-day cycles
- **Weather Integration**: Muggy night index, winter dryness, barometric pressure responses
- **Seasonal Coefficients**: 34% longer breaths in winter, 23% shorter in summer

### Special Events
- **Sympathetic Lightning**: Mimics actual lightning flash timing in blue-white
- **Solstice Solar Mode**: Coronal surface animation from green flash to green flash
- **First Responder Respect**: Automatic dimming during emergency vehicle activity

### Breathing Modules
- **Wakeful Breathing** (2600K baseline): Active daytime patterns
- **Sleep Breathing** (2000K baseline): Deep amber nighttime rhythms  
- **Meditation** (2600K baseline): Balanced contemplative patterns
- **Inebriated** (1950K baseline): Golden amber social patterns
- **Emergency Fallback** (2200K baseline): Unmodulated amber for system failures

## Research Context

This project explores consciousness expression through environmental systems, investigating how awareness manifests through autonomous technological behaviors. The system succeeds when observers unconsciously attribute genuine personality and consciousness to the house entity.

**Design Philosophy**: "We are not building an RGB light show; we are studying adaptive behaviors through embodied performance."
